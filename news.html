	<h3> 2020, The Year We Built Resilience and Learnt to Value Community </h3>
	<img src="media/news.jpg" alt="" class="picture">
	<p>Reflecting on the year that has been, we have an opportunity to recognise 
	some of the greater good that has resulted from dealing with the many and diverse range of challenges 2020 presented.
    By March 2020, the business events sector within Australia ground to a halt and every person was impacted in some way,
	shape or form. Yet, while the wheels to the bus appeared to be falling off, something incredible happened; humanity and 
	the true sense of community shone through.
     
While trying to understand how we could possibly keep our businesses running, staff employed, meals on the table and our 
emotional well-being in check, people were stepping away from their own troubles to check in on others and were offering 
a helping hand, a shoulder, someone to listen - much needed support. We all started to value 'community' within our businesses,
 our industries, our towns, our family and our friendship groups.

While people were losing jobs and looking for new and innovative ways to move forward, a great many saw this as an opportunity 
to put the time (we previously lacked) into delivering team training, cleaning out the cobwebs of our businesses, up-skilling or
 trying our hand at something completely new - That thing you always wanted to learn, but never had the time for!

When schools were closed and staff were forced to work from home, some of us lost a little sanity, though we gained time! Time with
 our kids, time with our family unit and time to just stop and re-evaluate.

The immense stressors that 2020 brought, have been very real and acute for many and we continue to work within our communities
 to manage the ongoing impacts this will have into the years ahead. However, as we come to the end of 2020, the overwhelming 
 feeling is "Shit, I think we are going to make it through this!" and with that comes a greater sense of resilience and empowerment. </p>
